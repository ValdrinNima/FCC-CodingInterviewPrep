# Take Home Projects - Build a freeCodeCamp Forum Homepage

**Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/JqdoMV.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story**: I can see a list of the most recent posts on the freeCodeCamp forum.

**User Story**: For each topic, I can see the title and a list of links to users who have recently posted in it.

**User Story**: I can see the number of replies and views that each topic has had, and a timestamp of when the topic was last active.
